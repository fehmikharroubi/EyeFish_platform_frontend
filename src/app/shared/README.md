# Shared Module

The `shared` folder contains **reusable building blocks** that can be used across multiple features.

### What to put here
- UI components (buttons, modals, tables)
- Pipes (formatting, date, currency)
- Directives (highlight, permissions)
- Utility functions

### Best practices
- Keep components **stateless/presentational**
- Avoid importing services that hold business logic
- Ensure reusability and independence
